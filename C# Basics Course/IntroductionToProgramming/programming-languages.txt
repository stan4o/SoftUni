Most used programming languages by TIOBE's Index (www.tiobe.com) are: C, Java, Objective-C, C++, C#, PHP, JavaScript (or atleast the first seven). And JavaScript is one of them that is similar to C# in some ways. It has dynamic variables declared with the keyword var and both support asynchronous programming. But they use different programming paradigms - C# and the others are object-oriented and JavaScript uses functional programming more than OOP. C# has a huge standart library with so much useful stuff than his competitor C++. And more so it has a  native garbage collector that is responsible for the disposal of non-used variables at runtime.
